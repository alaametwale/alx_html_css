# Headphones Landing Page

This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Web Development** track.  
The goal is to **implement a full landing page from scratch** using only:

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Responsive Design  
- Accessibility  
- Custom Icons  
- No external CSS frameworks  
- No JavaScript (until Task 8)

The design is fully based on the provided **Figma UI**, and all sections were implemented to match the layout exactly.
